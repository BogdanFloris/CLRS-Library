# Library

This repository provides implementations for popular algorithms and data structures, most of them presented in the book [Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

The algorithms are written in Python 3 and are split into two main packages:
1. Algorithms (sorting algorithms, graph algorithms)
2. Data Structures (Hash map, Heap, Red Black Tree, etc.)

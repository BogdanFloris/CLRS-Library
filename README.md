This repository provides implementations for the algorithms and data structures presented in the book [Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) and server as a learning exercise.

The algorithms are written in Python 3 and are split into two main packages:
1. Algorithms (sorting algorithms, graph algorithms)
2. Data Structures (Hash map, Heap, Red Black Tree, etc.)
